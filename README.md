## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to implement a custom-styled typing box, including handling user input, cursor behavior, and focus states. I also learned how to use requestAnimationFrame to manage smooth animations and synchronize rendering with the browser’s refresh cycle, improving performance compared to traditional timer-based approaches.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on translating design mockups into functional interfaces with high fidelity. I aim to refine my skills in accurately implementing spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy as outlined in the designs. Additionally, I want to improve my workflow for converting design components into reusable code patterns, ensuring consistency and efficiency across projects.
